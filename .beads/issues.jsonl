Do NOT modify gastown Go code.\n\n**Context**: \n- gt-4rk added dynamic default branch detection using git symbolic-ref\n- gt-5yl researched protected branch requirements\n\n**General Flow**:\n1. Detect default branch (via git symbolic-ref)\n2. If branch is unprotected → proceed with 'merge \u0026 push' onto default branch\n3. If branch is protected → create PR instead of direct merge\n\n**PR Tracking**:\nConsider including the MR or task ID in the PR (title or body). This allows the refinery to patrol PRs and correlate them back to the originating work item.\n\n**Objective**: Update the refinery formula instructions/steps to:\n1. Detect protected branches before attempting merge\n2. Handle cases where merge requirements are not met (create PR)\n3. Provide clear guidance in formula text for protected branch scenarios\n\n**Output**: Updated mol-refinery-patrol.formula.toml with protected branch handling instructions.","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"gastown_olpie1001/polecats/dementus","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:29:42.711887+01:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-10T23:30:28.704696+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-cvr","depends_on_id":"gt-xvo","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:30:08.878067+01:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"gt-cvr","depends_on_id":"gt-3je","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:30:09.758504+01:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"gt-cvr","depends_on_id":"gt-4rk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T20:04:26.983562+01:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
