Do NOT modify gastown Go code.\n\n**Context**: \n- gt-4rk added dynamic default branch detection using git symbolic-ref\n- gt-5yl researched protected branch requirements\n\n**General Flow**:\n1. Detect default branch (via git symbolic-ref)\n2. If branch is unprotected → proceed with 'merge \u0026 push' onto default branch\n3. If branch is protected → create PR instead of direct merge\n\n**PR Tracking**:\nConsider including the MR or task ID in the PR (title or body). This allows the refinery to patrol PRs and correlate them back to the originating work item.\n\n**Objective**: Update the refinery formula instructions/steps to:\n1. Detect protected branches before attempting merge\n2. Handle cases where merge requirements are not met (create PR)\n3.
